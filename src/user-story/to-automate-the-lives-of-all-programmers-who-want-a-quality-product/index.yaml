  title: Jenkins mapped out trucking logistics, plus management of drivers, travel
    itineraries, and expenses.
  paragraphs:
    - '**Background:** We needed a continuous integration solution that would
      quickly and easily deploy our versions. Because our customers who need
      this agility are located throughout Brazil, we could not be "of the air"
      and delayed with a time-consuming deployment. **Goals:** Control of fleet
      of trucks, drivers, travel, expenses, all through an integrated system to
      an application and a web system. **Solution & Results:** Our maturity as a
      developer unit was acquired with Jenkins and the continuous integration it
      supports to solve our difficulty in generating automatic builds. With
      Jenkins, our implementation process is very fast. We learned to use
      continuous integration, generating builds, and deploying software in a
      single, fully automated place. Our team has gained a lot of maturity with
      this process. These plugins were essential to our success with the
      platform and the quality of our product:'
    - |-
      *   Maven Plugin
      *   Amazon EC2 Plugin
      *   Pipeline Plugin
      *   Docker Plugin for Jenkins
      *   JUnit Plugin
    - "Three things that were quickly resolved:"
    - |-
      *   Faster builds saved us time for what really matters: development.
      *   Development cycles shortened from 1 week to 1 day
      *   Improved customer confidence in solving the problem immediately
