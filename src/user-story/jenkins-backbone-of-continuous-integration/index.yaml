  title: Jenkins - The Backbone of Continuous Integration.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Amarula Solutions places a strong emphasis on Continuous
      Delivery to enhance their development process and foster improved team
      cooperation. Their fundamental approach involves integrating various software
      tools to achieve greater efficiency in development and build processes,
      alongside the rapid identification of potential issues."
    - "**Goals:** Involve seamlessly integrating diverse software tools to significantly
      boost efficiency in development and build processes, while simultaneously enabling
      the rapid identification and resolution of potential issues."
    - "**Solution & Results:**
      Primary solution was to strong embrace of Continuous Delivery, which involves the
      strategic integration of multiple software tools. This concerted effort yields
      significant results, including a demonstrably enhanced development process,
      improved cooperation among their teams, and a notable increase in efficiency
      across their development and build operations. Furthermore, this approach enables
      them to swiftly identify and address potential issues, leading to a more robust
      and streamlined workflow."
    - "Here's how Jenkins is an integral part of Amarula Solutions' story:"
    - |-
      *   **Automated Verification:** Whenever a developer submits a commit to Gerrit,
          Jenkins springs into action. It automatically fetches the commit and runs a
          verification build. This crucial step ensures that the new changes haven't broken
          the existing codebase. If a build fails, Jenkins automatically notifies the team (via Mattermost)
          and retains logs for troubleshooting.
      *   **Development Flow and Quality Gates:** Jenkins is deeply integrated into Amarula's
          development flow:
          - New changes or patchsets in Gerrit automatically trigger Jenkins verification jobs.
          - These jobs can build the product, run tests, and perform static code analysis
            (using tools like Sonarqube and Codechecker).
          - Jenkins posts verification scores back to Gerrit, ensuring that changes are merged
            only after meeting specific quality standards (e.g., +2 review score and +1 verification score).
          - Static code analysis results, including new violations, are provided directly to Gerrit,
            allowing developers to address issues proactively.
      *   **Flexible Build Triggers:** Beyond automatic triggers from Gerrit, builds can also be initiated
          manually by users through the Jenkins UI or scheduled to run at specific times.
      *   **Distributed Builds with Slave Nodes:** Amarula Solutions utilizes Jenkins slave nodes, which can be
          configured with specific operating systems or hardware to handle different types of jobs.
          This allows for powerful machines to build Android OS, while basic nodes can handle Android
          app builds, and dedicated nodes with connected test devices run automated tests.
          This distributed architecture enhances efficiency and scalability.
      *   **Optimized Downloads with Proxy Cache:** To reduce the time spent downloading dependencies for builds,
          Jenkins uses a dedicated Docker container that acts as a proxy cache. This container caches all
          artifacts that have been requested at least once, significantly speeding up subsequent builds.
      *   **Shared Libraries for Reusability:** Amarula Solutions extracts common pipeline code into shared
          Jenkins libraries. This approach reduces redundancy, keeps code clean, and ensures consistency
          across various projects. These libraries handle tasks like checking out source code, running builds
          in specific Docker environments, and providing build results to communication channels.
      *   **Release Automation:** Jenkins pipelines are used to automate the entire release process for
          Android applications, including building and uploading app bundles to the Google Play Store.
          This includes signing the bundles with secure keys and persisting uploaded bundles and
          configurations for tracking.
      *   **Multi-Repository Projects:** For complex projects composed of multiple Git repositories (like AOSP),
          Jenkins can handle cross-dependent code changes. It can check out all related changes across all
          repositories under the same Gerrit topic, ensuring that verification builds are performed on a
          consistent and complete codebase.
      *   **Security Integration (Mend):** Jenkins pipelines are extended to automatically run Mend scans, which
          detect and remediate security and compliance issues in open-source components. The results are sent
          to communication channels, tagging project owners to ensure timely action on vulnerabilities.
      *   **Parametrized Builds:** Jenkins allows users to configure builds conveniently via a graphical interface
          using parameters. This enables setting options such as specific software flavors, build types
          (production vs. debug), source code revisions, and deployment targets.
      *   **Changelog Generation:** A dedicated Jenkins changelog library is used to automatically generate changelogs
          between specified start and end references, providing clear documentation of changes for each build.
      *   **Beyond Software Development:** Jenkins' capabilities extend beyond traditional software development at Amarula Solutions.
          They utilize Jenkins jobs and graphical interfaces to automate processes not directly related to software,
          such as generating employee reports by accessing APIs from YouTrack and Gerrit, filtering data, and producing XML reports
          for invoicing. This demonstrates Jenkins' versatility as an automation platform.
