  title: Jenkins freestyle project paves the way for ease of deployment.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** I work at an IT solutions and services company in Kuala
      Lumpur. For my Jenkins user story, I thought I'd share a start-up project
      we created for a foreign resources application. We wanted to achieve a
      faster and more reliable deployment that provided more manageable product
      releases -- an automated system that can pick up and build the code from
      our Maven repository and deploy it directly to our Tomcat servers. This
      was proving to be complex because we have a different Git repository for
      each module."
    - "**Goals:** End-to-end integration for a management process."
    - "**Solution & Results:** I configured a Jenkins freestyle project for our
      Foreign Resources application. Our application is composed of multiple
      REST services Java projects. Each project has its own corresponding Git
      repository URL."
    - In each repository, there are at least two folders; one is a jar, and one
      is a war. In the Source Code Management tab, I selected Multiple SCMs and
      defined every Git repository URL that I have. I determined which branch to
      build and the sub-directory from that repository. By using the freestyle
      project, I was able to combine our multiple SCMs.
    - In the Build Execution shell, I defined the command for maven to build,
      compile and package our projects. Once everything was ready, I copied it
      to the destination IP server. Then, I created a separate trigger for the
      build and deploy process.
    - "Jenkins eased the build and deployment process of our project. The
      current Jenkins solution feature we used is the most straightforward
      configuration and served the purpose. It gave us great results:"
    - >-
      *   builds are faster and more reliable

      *   quicker deployments: from 30 minutes to 4.4 seconds

      *   build and deploy configuration to a newly setup server is very convenient

      *   developers can build and deploy within their own dev environment

      *   concurrent builds help a lot on our productivity
