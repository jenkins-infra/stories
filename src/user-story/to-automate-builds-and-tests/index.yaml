  title: Reducing time needed for code fixes helps developers work more
    efficiently when bugs are present and then spend more time innovating.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** We use Jenkins for CI/CD so developers and testers can
      work parallelly. Every night an automated system pulls the code added to
      the shared repository throughout the day and builds that code. The idea is
      quite similar to continuous integration, but since the code that was built
      at night was quite large, locating and fixing bugs was a real pain."
    - "**Goals:** Creating a data warehousing solution for business users to
      analyze data and report creation purposes."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - Due to the issues highlighted above, Citibank adopted continuous
      integration (CI). As a result, every commit made to the source code in the
      repository was built. If the build result shows that there is a bug in the
      code, then the developers only need to check that particular commit. This
      significantly reduced the time required to release new software.
    - The key capabilities we relied on were GIT Jenkins Plugin for automated
      build creation from GIT. We also used the TestProject plugin for automated
      orchestration of test cases.
    - What happened?
    - |-
      *   Faster code fixes
      *   Development cycles shortened.
      *   Automated and faster builds
