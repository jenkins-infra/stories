  title: "Securing the enterprise cloud with Jenkins."
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** As a developer dedicated to ensuring security & compliance in the cloud, we needed to create a complete CI/CD pipeline that was ultra-secure and auditable during every stage of our development process.  
      **Goals:** Build a security framework for IBM Cloud  
      **Solution & Results:** Using Jenkins, we could quickly build and deploy our framework from staging to production and complete a CI/CD pipeline. Jenkins made it simple for us to deploy multiple servers at a time. It was also straightforward and relatively effortless to integrate with the help of Ansible. The key capability we relied on was Jenkinsfile. Without the Jenkins containerized version, it would be extremely difficult to manage the build and deployment. With Jenkins, we got great results, including the ability to:"

      * Deploy multiple server patches 30x faster than normal processes  
      * Reduce release time from 7 to 4 days  
      * Decrease build server costs with a containerised Jenkins build
