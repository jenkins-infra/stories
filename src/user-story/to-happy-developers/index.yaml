  title: Testing improvements allow for aggressive development with fewer errors.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** IAM Robotics is a team of world-class engineers focused
      on delivering innovation and operational value that is transforming the
      material handling industry. Originally, we had cumbersome testing
      processes that required us to manually verify our code on the robotic
      hardware, which was slow and prone to errors. These manual processes
      included running existing unit tests, generating release packages, testing
      internal networks, and numerous regression tests. We needed to be able to
      streamline the processes to reduce errors and efficiently validate and
      test our code, both virtually and on robotic hardware. And we needed to
      reduce test time from hours to minutes."
    - "**Goals:** Improving testing efficiency and reducing errors."
    - "**Solution & Results:** By adopting Jenkins, we implemented an automated
      pipeline for building and validating our codebase. This allowed us to have
      release packages available for robots at the click of a button. It also
      eliminated the need for a developer to manually create release packages,
      which was a time-consuming and error-prone process. Instead of using a
      large server configuration, what makes our Jenkins instance unique is that
      we deploy this process across multiple pieces of robotic hardware. Jenkins
      accesses the robotic hardware directly to allow the build process to be
      fully automated without impacting the general operation of robots,
      simplifying and speeding up the deployment process. Jenkins easily
      integrates with other development tools we use to evaluate our code, and
      it helps to identify bugs and potential issues before they impact
      deployment. Further, it automatically provides feedback to developers so
      they can quickly debug and improve the robustness of the codebase.
      Cumulatively, these improvements have allowed us to develop aggressively
      with fewer errors. The capabilities we relied on most include Jenkins
      pipelines, Jenkins webhooks, Bitbucket webhooks, CloudBees stable plugin
      manager, and Jenkins Node and Agent networking. Overall, we're thrilled with the results."
