  title: Accelerating core software development.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** A solid and secure technology platform is a critical
      foundation for any bank. But for this development team, there was a need
      to enable rapid innovation while simultaneously reducing manual
      intervention. They needed a complete CI/CD solution for fast, agile, and
      simplified development as well as a more streamlined deployment process
      for the entire company."
    - "**Goals:** To accelerate core software development."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We implemented a sturdy solution using Jenkins,
      BitBucket and Maven. And we wrote a number of custom scripts to enable our
      solution. Based on the nature of our products, we had to get creative, as
      most of the solutions out there weren't really a good fit."
    - "After a lot of brainstorming, scripting, coding and diagramming, the end
      product is something we can be proud of. Basically, it solved all our
      problems and fulfilled our dreams. Results we're experiencing include:"
    - |-
      *   Simplified & streamlined deployment process
      *   Introduction of coding and development standards
      *   Cut manual deployment efforts almost entirely
