  title: A platform that gives developers new freedom and provides a single source
    of truth for all.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Our company's sole focus is digital transformation, so it
      is important that we provide this to our clients. For one large telecom
      client, we needed quicker development feedback cycles, from code commit to
      release. We wanted automatic quality assurance at different stages of the
      process. These variables included: code coverage target, sonar issues
      analysis, fortify, unit test, integration tests, front end validations,
      and more. We also needed better oversight of deployment to different
      environments to support various operating systems."
    - "**Goals:** State-of-the-art telecommunications management platform, with
      the use of agnostic hardware."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - Jenkins allowed us to have a rigorous and reliable development process.
      The continuous delivery of the software process was designed and
      architectured in a very transparent manner. This allowed the
      identification of all the steps and components in a straightforward and
      effortless manner.
    - That drove us – the development team – to look into our Jenkins pipeline
      as a powerful support tool and one of our safeguards in our daily work.
      Jenkins was part of our conversation in our Agile retrospectives, or root
      cause analysis, to automate more and more of the process or pieces that we
      hadn't even thought about before.
    - We started with night builds that would run some selenium tests, and we
      ended up with a complete analysis on every commit and deployments on every
      merge request. This included improvements in integration, front-end and
      load tests, as well as security analysis.
    - We used the Jenkins Pipeline plugin, which helps us approach
      infrastructure and the pipeline as a software set that can now be
      versioned. That was a big plus. Also, it simplified the design, as all
      were described in one file.
    - The use of the Jira plugin was also a great plus. It allows us to keep
      pipeline aspects visible in Jira as our source-of-truth tool. This is
      really important, as Jenkins is a developer's tool that management is not
      familiar with. This made it possible to incorporate management visibility
      as well.
    - "We are pleased with our enhancements, resulting in:"

      *   quality improvement
      *   a relaxed development environment
      *   ownership mindset growth
