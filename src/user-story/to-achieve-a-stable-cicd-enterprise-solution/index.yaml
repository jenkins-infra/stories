  title: Faster builds and fewer errors with CI/CD automation.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** The tools for this finance company are heavily
      restricted, so the tech team was spending an inordinate amount of time
      trying to figure out what to use and how to execute necessary tasks. The
      security constraints imposed on them limited them significantly –
      particularly when it came to the use of plugins. Because of this, they
      were forced to use extensive bash scripts to supplement the tools
      provided. Another huge challenge was the need to trial all possible
      solutions for each of the necessary steps to be confident they designed
      things correctly. Finally, they had to figure out how to incorporate
      BladeLogic into the CI/CD picture."
    - "**Goals:** Automate the build-and-deploy process for this organization."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We used Jenkins to provide the orchestration
      needed for each build and deployment. With Jenkins, we were able to make
      the connection to Nexus repository, pull source code from BitBucket, and
      create the BladeLogic packages. Unfortunately, due to all of the internal
      security restrictions, we could only rely on basic Jenkins capabilities.
      Our team wanted to use Groovy scripts from the onset, but we ended up
      filling pre- and post-build steps, replacing several plugins with bash
      scripts (as the Jenkins agent is on RHEL)."
    - "Jenkins rocks because it provided the platform to automate our builds,
      whereas previously, all tasks were executed manually. Since the
      implementation:"
    - >-
      *   builds are faster

      *   builds have fewer errors

      *   deployment is automated and fast => happier banks

      *   our BitBucket and Nexus libraries are managed and maintained with fewer errors
