  title: Increasing quality and ensuring IoT software passes all tests pre-deployment.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** As a QA lead at this multinational company, we needed an
      all-encompassing solution for consumers to connect all devices, no matter
      which protocol they used, and create viable interactions between them.
      This was a massive team effort as developers for different factions are
      spread out internationally."
    - "**Goals:** We started with Jenkins to run our full test suites on the
      test environment each morning to have a complete status at the start of
      the day."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Once we got our full test suites running every
      morning, they allowed us to quickly identify issues and flaky tests. Once
      tests were stable enough, we started on-demand deployments through
      Jenkins, which also runs related tests after the deployment, allowing us
      to verify changes quickly."
    - The next step was to also run tests on the staging environment. It ensured
      that anything deployed to production was working.
    - Finally, we started running a subset of our tests in production every
      hour, with Jenkins notifying us of any failure. Once confident in our
      solution using Jenkins, we added jobs, computing reports from analytics,
      and logs to drive us to increase our test coverage.
    - In the end, Jenkins allowed us to have a clear vision on what to do to
      improve our quality and to ensure everything released was passing our
      tests.
    - We looked for capabilities and notifications plugins that allowed for job
      parameterization, scheduling, and notifications. We found all of that and
      more.
    - What results are we seeing?
    - |-
      *   safer deployments
      *   on-demand deployments
      *   better reaction time
      *   production monitoring
