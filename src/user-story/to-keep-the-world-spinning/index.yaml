  title: Jenkins & CI/CD keeping project information and code safe while in a
    private dev environment.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Before this solution, the DevOps team at IBM in Mexico
      had to build our packager manually. This took too much time: more than six
      hours for each face of the compilation process. Additionally, an expert
      developer must constantly monitor the process in case of a failure. We
      created a job for each build face in Jenkins and it simplified and saved
      us a lot of time in the build process, also helped us to detect some
      failures that we weren't aware of. **Goals:** Save developer time by
      creating a better CI/CD process. **Solution & Results:** Jenkins helped us
      to split our challenge into phases and separate jobs. We had jobs for new
      releases and daily builds for CI/CD. This way, the developer can do a
      better job, and work faster. By creating a job for each build in Jenkins,
      the whole process was simplified. It saved us a lot of time in the build
      process. It also helped us to detect some failures that we weren't aware
      of. As this is a project in a private environment, security plugins have
      been the most important capabilities we have used. It's really important
      to keep our info and code safe. Results we saw from integrating Jenkins
      include:"
    - |-
      *   build time is 200% faster
      *   improved product performance
      *   test cycles are 100% faster
      *   accelerated release delivery
