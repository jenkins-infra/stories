  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Before this solution, the DevOps team at IBM in Mexico had to build our packager manually. This took too much time: more than six hours for each phase of the compilation process. Additionally, an expert developer had to constantly monitor the process in case of failure. We created a job for each build phase in Jenkins, and it simplified and saved us a lot of time in the build process. It also helped us detect failures we weren't aware of.  
      **Goals:** Save developer time by creating a better CI/CD process.  
      **Solution & Results:** Jenkins helped us split our challenge into phases and separate jobs. We had jobs for new releases and daily builds for CI/CD. This way, developers could work faster and more effectively. By creating a job for each build in Jenkins, the whole process was simplified. It saved us a lot of time in the build process and helped us detect failures earlier. Since this project is in a private environment, security plugins have been the most important capabilities we used to keep our info and code safe. Results we saw from integrating Jenkins include:"
    - |
      * Build time is 200% faster  
      * Improved product performance  
      * Test cycles are 100% faster  
      * Accelerated release delivery
