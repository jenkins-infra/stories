    jenkinsfile-dynamatrix is the way to find what can be built today
  paragraphs:
    - The Network UPS Tools project will soon be a quarter of a century old and,
      being the first open multi-vendor power hardware monitoring solution for
      UPS, ePDU, Solar and such, it became the de facto standard in this area
      (de jure with RFC 9271 recently published). Over the years it was embedded
      in all sorts of server and desktop operating systems, from embedded to
      mainframe and NAS, and built with a wide array of toolkits and third-party
      dependencies. As evolution marches on, warnings are eradicated and
      features are added, the codebase is still expected to run on any platform
      released over the past couple of decades. If the machines and their OSes
      still run, modern NUT should too.
    - With one of my first goals as an active community member and eventually
      project maintainer, I set out to address the hundreds of compiler warnings
      emitted by different implementations and versions of toolkits during
      builds -- since they did raise valid concerns, and presence of those
      reports obscured visibility of new bugs introduced by contributions. In
      fact, several large and useful changes sat in the PR queue for years
      because nobody including authors had a good grasp on their reliability.
      This "fightwarn" effort took a couple of years with an in-house Jenkins
      farm for a project using NUT, and Travis CI (free for FOSS at that time)
      as well as one team members' BuildBot instance handling several versions
      of Linux for a few CPU architectures to cover different bitness and
      endianness, as well as a mix of GCC and LLVM CLANG. Quite a few issues
      were only relevant to certain generations of toolkits, C standard
      revisions, Make or Shell implementations, Autotools versions... and some
      fixes for one platform caused bugs for another. So to keep NUT working
      everywhere its iterations had to be regularly built everywhere.
    - "Eventually the reign of Travis CI ended, and NUT got VMs for a CI farm
      sponsored by Fosshost to proceed with the multi-platform testing. Using a
      custom Jenkins instance to take care of the project's codebase builds and
      make use of numerous operating systems in other VMs (as SSH Build Agents),
      as well as build agents contributed by community (e.g. Swarm agents), was
      a natural choice: by that time work had started on the
      https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix project. It is a
      Jenkins shared library which constructs a huge Map of parallel stages
      similar to a standard matrix build."
    - However in this case, build agents are expected to report capabilities
      with their labels -- such as which platform they run and what versions and
      implementations of toolkits are available to test with, and whether
      "everything" can be built or just certain profiles (not all OS
      distributions offer all of the dependencies that NUT can build against).
      The library also helps determine which C/C++ revisions can be built
      according to GCC or CLANG version installed. Whenever a build starts, the
      NUT Jenkinsfile (consumer of jenkins-dynamatrix library) can evaluate what
      it can build today -- based on currently known population of build agents,
      and so constructs the matrix for testing.
    - This arrangement allows NUT to be built on a multitude of platforms such
      that common free CI platforms do not offer. It is possible to find ways to
      build FOSS on recent Linux, MacOS and Windows, and sometimes even on
      non-x86 CPUs. It is nearly impossible to find builders for FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD or Solaris/illumos, to name a few, or on Linux distributions older
      than half a dozen years.
    - Every iteration of NUT is now tested with GNU, BSD and Sun Make
      implementations, with Shell helpers tested by Bash, Dash, Ksh, Busybox and
      others, with GCC starting from early 4.x releases and Clang from 3.x up to
      the dozenth releases out recently, across a dozen hardware platforms (some
      in QEMU), and several revisions of C/C++ standard with and without GNU
      extensions. All in all, with recently regularly connected builders about
      150 stages are prepared (some running several build scenarios as scripted
      inside, so roughly a thousand builds happen). Sometimes a nuance warning
      causes one of these scenarios to complain during PR builds -- on this or
      that OS, this or that compiler. It keeps us confident both that such
      mechanism remains useful, and that any OS the community cares about enough
      to contribute a builder for remains fully supported.
    - With the hundreds of builds succeeding without warnings -- reliably,
      repeatably, every time -- the floodgates for ingestion of long-standing
      PRs were open. Largest beasts included the dual-citizenship with
      libusb-0.1 and libusb-1.x support (queued for 5 years) and revival of NUT
      for Windows effort (queued for 9 years), confidently merged without
      introducing warnings and regressions.
    - Of notable interactions with the Jenkins community, this and related
      efforts led to improvements in the git-client-plugin to extend the use of
      reference repositories, instant-messaging-plugin and ircbot-plugin for
      querying Jenkins server status via IRC servers, lockable-resources plugin
      for many itches scratched here and there, and pipeline-groovy-lib-plugin
      for easier use of test library versions along with test pipeline branches.
      And very many lessons learned :)
