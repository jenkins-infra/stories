    jenkinsfile-dynamatrix is the way to find what can be built today

      The [Network UPS Tools](https://networkupstools.org)
      [project](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut) will soon be a quarter of a century
      old and, being the first open multi-vendor power hardware monitoring
      solution for UPS, ePDU, Solar and such, it became the de facto standard in
      this area (de jure with RFC 9271 recently published). Over the years it
      was embedded in all sorts of server and desktop operating systems, from
      embedded to mainframe and NAS, and built with a wide array of toolkits and
      third-party dependencies. As evolution marches on, warnings are eradicated
      and features are added, the codebase is still expected to run on any
      platform released over the past couple of decades. If the machines and
      their OSes still run, modern NUT should too.
    - |-
      With one of my first goals as an active community member and eventually
      project maintainer, I set out to address the hundreds of compiler warnings
      emitted by different implementations and versions of toolkits during
      builds -- since they did raise valid concerns, and presence of those
      reports obscured visibility of new bugs introduced by contributions. In
      fact, several large and useful changes sat in the PR queue for years
      because nobody including authors had a good grasp on their reliability.
      This "fightwarn" effort took a couple of years with an in-house Jenkins
      farm for a project using NUT, and Travis CI (free for FOSS at that time)
      as well as one team members' BuildBot instance handling several versions
      of Linux for a few CPU architectures to cover different bitness and
      endianness, as well as a mix of GCC and LLVM CLANG. Quite a few issues
      were only relevant to certain generations of toolkits, C standard
      revisions, Make or Shell implementations, Autotools versions... and some
      fixes for one platform caused bugs for another. So to keep NUT working
      everywhere its iterations had to be regularly built everywhere.
    - |-
      Eventually the reign of free Travis CI ended, and NUT got VMs for a CI
      farm sponsored by [Fosshost.org](https://fosshost.org/) and later by
      [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d2fbf2b9e082&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge)
      to proceed with the multi-platform testing.
    - |-
      Using a custom Jenkins instance to take care of the project's codebase
      builds and make use of numerous operating systems in other VMs (as SSH
      Build Agents), as well as build agents contributed by community (e.g.
      Swarm agents), was a natural choice: by that time work had started on the
      [https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix](https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-dynamatrix)
      project. It is a Jenkins shared
      library which constructs a huge Map of parallel stages similar to a
      standard matrix build.
    - |-
      However in this case, it is not the static matrix definition fully dictating
      what should be built, but rather the build agents are expected to report
      capabilities with their labels -- such as which platform they run and what
      versions and implementations of toolkits are available to test with, and
      whether "everything" can be built or just certain profiles (not all OS
      distributions offer all of the dependencies that NUT can build against).
      The library also helps determine which C or C++ language revisions can be
      built according to GCC or CLANG version installed. Whenever a build
      starts, the NUT Jenkinsfile (consumer of jenkins-dynamatrix library) can
      evaluate what it can build today -- based on currently known population of
      build agents, and so constructs the matrix for testing.
    - |-
      A sibling [https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-swarm-nutci](https://github.com/networkupstools/jenkins-swarm-nutci)
      project is used on many of the build agents which can dial in to the NUT CI
      farm and provide their services and capabilities (conveyed by the labels
      which are part of their configuration), and includes some scripting for a
      common configuration approach as well as for automated start-up on numerous
      platforms. It might be usable "as is" or easily adapted by other projects.
    - |-
      This arrangement allows NUT to be built on a multitude of platforms such
      that common free CI platforms do not offer. It is possible to find ways to
      build FOSS on recent Linux, MacOS and Windows, and sometimes even on
      non-x86 CPUs. It is nearly impossible to find builders for FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD or Solaris/illumos, to name a few, or on Linux distributions older
      than half a dozen years.
    - |-
      Every iteration of NUT is now tested with GNU, BSD and Sun Make
      implementations, with Shell helpers tested by Bash, Dash, Ksh, Busybox and
      others, with GCC starting from early 4.x releases and Clang from 3.x up to
      the dozenth releases out recently, across a dozen hardware platforms (some
      in QEMU), and several revisions of C/C++ standard with and without GNU
      extensions. All in all, with recently regularly connected builders about
      250 stages are prepared (some running several build scenarios as scripted
      inside, so roughly a thousand builds happen). Sometimes a nuance warning
      causes one of these scenarios to complain during PR builds -- on this or
      that OS, this or that compiler. It keeps us confident both that such
      mechanism remains useful, and that any OS the community cares about enough
      to contribute a builder for remains fully supported.
    - |-
      With the hundreds of builds succeeding without warnings -- reliably,
      repeatably, every time -- the floodgates for ingestion of long-standing
      PRs were open. Largest beasts included the dual-citizenship with
      libusb-0.1 and libusb-1.x support (queued for 5 years) and revival of the
      NUT for Windows effort (queued for 9 years), confidently merged without
      introducing warnings and regressions. The overwhelming majority of these
      builds happen on the custom "NUT CI" farm with Jenkins driving them. A few
      scenarios run on CircleCI and Appveyor to take advantage of some free FOSS
      builds on MacOS and Windows respectively.
    - |-
      Of notable interactions with the Jenkins community, this and related
      efforts led to improvements in the git-client-plugin to extend the use of
      reference repositories, instant-messaging-plugin and ircbot-plugin for
      querying Jenkins server status via IRC servers, lockable-resources plugin
      for many itches scratched here and there, and pipeline-groovy-lib-plugin
      for easier use of test library versions along with test pipeline branches.
      And very many lessons learned and friends made :)
