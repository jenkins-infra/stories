  title: For instant payments, this financial firm turned to Jenkins for automated
    testing -- and more of it.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** The Hungarian National Bank made a proposal to implement
      instant payment solutions in Hungary and launched it in March 2020. The
      purpose was to make payments available between Hungarian payment accounts
      within seconds, on a 24/7/365 basis. In our bank, we had already
      implemented this functionality by the end of 2019, but we needed a
      solution to test it. There were strict acceptance criteria that our
      solution should be able to handle a certain number of requests during
      working hours, another amount of requests during the evening, even fewer
      requests at night, and so on."
    - "**Goals:** The goal of this project was to test the performance of
      instant payments."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - We chose Gatling as the load testing tool and used Maven as the build
      tool. In the beginning, we ran these tests by hand but it was not
      sufficient, and since we wanted the tests to run after working hours, we
      needed an automated way. The other aspect is that we wanted to save test
      summary reports and it was difficult if every developer ran tests on his
      or her own machine.
    - We also needed to run these daily performance tests more frequently and in
      a distributed way. Determining that the jobs should be parametrized, we
      located the Parameterized Scheduler in the Jenkins Plugins index, with
      which we can schedule and run these tests for months. Hat-tip to the
      awesome community of Jenkins for that suggestion. We have eight Jenkins
      slaves, so the test distribution was easy with this setup. With the
      Jenkins Gatling plugin, every test summary was shown on the job's page, so
      our non-technical coworkers can easily view the latest results, as well as
      the previous reports and previous builds summary.
    - "Key capabilities used include:"
    - >-
      *   Parameterized Scheduler -- a useful plugin if you need to run a
      parametrized job on a particular schedule.

      *   Gatling plugin -- this plugin is also awesome because it displays the result of the test on the job's overview page.
    - "The results are typical of many other Jenkins installations:"
    - |-
      *   improved product quality was improved
      *   test cycles were shortened
      *   test summaries are easily and automatically stored
