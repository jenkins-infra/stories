  title: Automating image deployment with Jenkins at LinuxWorld.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** *The LinuxWorld India training program allows students to
      work on live projects provided by the organization. In this way, they get
      real exposure to the IT industry. LinuxWorld offers training in the city
      of Jaipur, with a team of highly experienced and expert trainers. The
      students can enroll in programs like DevOps, Docker, Splunk, Cloud
      Computing, Big Data Hadoop, RedHat certified programs, Python, Splunk,
      python during their training program.*"
    - I am an ML engineer intern with Congle India and a student at Jaipur
      Engineering College. I am sharing the DevOps project I tackled at Linux
      World. I was tasked with integrating DevOps, Jenkins, and Docker to
      automate the deployment of the web pages. I am a beginner working with
      Jenkins, but it has been an excellent training resource for me to learn
      and do the work.
    - "**Goals:** To create a container image with Jenkins installed using
      Dockerfile so that the image will launch automatically when Jenkins starts
      its services."
    - "**Solution & Results:** By using the Jcontainer image that has Jenkins
      installed, we can successfully – and automatically – launch the image once
      Jenkins is deployed. To do so, I created the following job chain using the
      build pipeline plugin in Jenkins:"
    - "**Job 1:** Pull the Github repo automatically when developers push the
      repo to Github. No alt-text was provided for this image."
    - "**Job 2:** By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should
      automatically start the respective language interpreter and install an
      image container to deploy the code. For example, if the code is PHP, then
      Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed. No
      alt-text was provided for this image."
    - "**Job 3:** Test your app to determine if it is working or not. No
      alt-text was provided for this image."
    - "**Job 4:** If the app is not working, send an email to the developer with
      error messages: No alt-text provided for this image."
    - "By using Jenkins to automate the container image, it was:"
