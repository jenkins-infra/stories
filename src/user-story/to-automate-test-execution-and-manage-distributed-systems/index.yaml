  title: Multimedia telephony application server supported with powerful CI/CD.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** To support a carrier-class application server for voice
      and multimedia, we wanted to achieve a more reliable CI/CD system. We
      needed a stable platform that would allow any developer to contribute to a
      400-machine-worthy distributed system."
    - "**Goals:** Simplify and modernize CI/CD architecture for the product."
    - '**Solution & Results:** We used Jenkins Job Builder and Pipeline to build
      up a "Job-as-a-Code" deployment process and a lightweight framework of
      pipeline building blocks to support our requirements. This enables
      individuals with varying skill sets to contribute or build their own jobs
      to meet their project needs.'
    - With these building blocks, we could reach feature parity with the new
      implementation much faster, with less code. Best of all, we could
      distribute our solution to other parts of the organization, reducing
      overall fragmentation and parallel efforts.
    - To make this happen, we used Jenkins Pipeline plugins for the foundation
      of the solution. We also used the Lockable Resources plugin for custom
      test channels and Jenkins Job Builder for job deployment.
    - "Jenkins provides the base infrastructure for our CI/CD pipeline. It is
      easy to reuse the building blocks and customize them for our specific
      needs. It means less boilerplate code and more focus on actually getting
      things done. This new architecture has delivered excellent results,
      including:"
    - |-
      *   faster development
      *   less coding required
      *   more test coverage and fewer issues with the CI executions
      *   shared knowledge within the organization
