  title: Bringing innovators and investors together in the digital startup space.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Mühlemann & Popp is a Swiss-based firm that creates
      digital business models and develops them into successful companies.
      Innovators bring them an idea for a business, and M\\&P delivers digital
      competence and the IT team to bring those ideas to life in the online
      space. Since 2010, their team of 20 engineers and business developers have
      created over ten successful startups."
    - "**Goals:** To help discover new ideas that needed a digital jump-start,
      M\\&P created Dealflow, an IT competition. Not only did this bring smart
      ideas to light, but Dealflow also helps entrepreneurs with good ideas find
      money to inject into their business from investors looking to invest in
      excellent digital solutions. The biggest obstacle was communications
      during the app development process. M\\&P needed to amplify the QA process
      with a notification system that would deliver messages to the appropriate
      decision-makers concerning code successes and next steps. This was
      especially important considering project finance decisions."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Jenkins helps M\\&P run tests and save reports
      quickly and easily for the analytics team. We use Allure reporting with
      screenshots in case of failures. For the automated pipeline system, we
      have two QA's built-in, triggered by time and commits. And the Slack
      plugin helps us send test reports to those who need to be kept informed
      during the project."
    - The key capabilities we relied on were varied. For the QA team, we looked
      for capabilities and notifications plugins that showed business progress
      and highlighted the product's quality. For the developers, we relied on
      the Allure plugin to indicate technical details as they relate to
      failures.
    - "The results are typical of many other Jenkins installations:"
    - >-
      *   increased number of new releases: for our purposes, 1X / week

      *   team managers always know the status of a project at every stage of development

      *   issues can be highlighted, discovered, and remedied quickly
