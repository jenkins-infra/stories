  title: Building a large CI platform to support app development.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background: This technology company offers a note-taking app that
      understands any handwritten content. It is deployed in hundreds of
      millions of touch screens globally; in mobile devices, vehicles,
      interactive whiteboards, etc. For that, this tech team needed a large
      continuous integration platform to support its large user base, multiple
      translations, and to accelerate feature releases at scale.**"
    - "**Goals:** Build a large CI platform to support note-taking applications
      and character recognition."
    - "**Solution & Results:** To create our CI platform, we relied on several
      Jenkins instances, many build nodes, and top-of-the-line hardware. The
      Jenkins capabilities deployed included node managements, many plugins, and
      pipeline jobs."
    - "Jenkins helps us to manage many nodes at a large scale. It also yielded
      great results, including:"
    - |-
      *   quicker builds
      *   better node management
      *   pipelines
