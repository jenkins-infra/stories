    - "**Background:** Alec Rieger is a Lead Software Engineer for a department
      in IBM that is currently a Chef shop, an open-source cloud configuration
      that translates system administration tasks into reusable definitions,
      otherwise known as \"cookbooks.\" The team is in the transition to
      becoming an Ansible engine, open-source software that doesn't rely on a
      client-server model. Ansible takes difficult tasks and turns them into
      repeatable \"playbooks,\" simplifying matters greatly and speeding up
      production. \"We have 500+ cookbooks and will have as many or more Ansible
      playbooks,\" says Rieger. \"We use Jenkins to simplify our testing, build,
      and deploy process. It helps us stay consistent across the board.\""
    - "**Goals:** Simplifying the build and testing pipeline for our SREs and
      developers."
    - "**Solution & Results:** According to Rieger, \"We are currently running
      four Jenkins masters in different regions to keep them redundant. And we
      have eight agents per master because we are still running on virtual
      machines. We haven't made the switch to containers yet, so we can spin up
      agents on demand.\" Rieger's team's servers run builds on each Chef
      cookbook on a daily basis and handle countless jobs per day during normal
      work hours. \"Our Jenkins setup allows for all of our projects to be
      consistent in the way it is built, tested, and versioned,\" Rieger added.
      \"Jenkins handles running the static code analysis, testing, and git
      versioning.\" It also keeps the entire team aware of progress in
      real-time. \"Jenkins both emails and notifies via Slack for successes and
      failures,\" says Rieger. \"So our team has insight into every build.\"  
      Jenkins helps IBM manage many nodes on a large scale. \"We use Jenkins
      pipelines for each of our builds,\" adds Rieger. \"The plugin community
      gives us a lot of flexibility and countless features that we can use to
      improve our processes.\" And it has yielded great results, including:"
    - |-
      * consistent testing  
      * consistent builds  
      * insight into builds  
      * shortened development release cycles
