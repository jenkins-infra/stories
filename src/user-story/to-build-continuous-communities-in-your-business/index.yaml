  title: Turning developers into collaborators with automation and CI/CD.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** This solutions architect set out to implement a smarter
      version control system across the technology team of this
      services-oriented oil and gas company. In doing so, it would be critical
      for the organization to embrace Continuous Integration and Continuous
      Delivery. He approached the challenge of educating the team about CI/CD
      but found it to be less challenging than anticipated due primarily to the
      integration of Jenkins solutions."
    - "**Goals:** Create internal functions for Office 365 products and internal
      integrations."
    - "**Solution & Results:** By implementing a new CI/CD solution, we now have
      builds and releases for every module. Multiple teams can contribute to
      modules and help one another. We have increased productivity and allowed
      for collaboration within departments. This process is helping us move away
      from silos.\\*\\*\\*\\*"
    - "Although we are still in the learning process, having a pipeline is the
      biggest win for us so far! Jenkins helped us visualize our steps and
      identify and respond to broken manual processes. We reduced our build
      times and release schedules! The results to date include:"
    - |-
      *   reduced build times by 3x
      *   better code review and collaboration processes
      *   faster release cadence
