  title: Automation allows product owner to execute more tests faster, and to
    analyze/mitigate failures in no time.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** We were looking to run functional test cases
      automatically as they were taking much too long to execute as a manual
      process. We also wanted a solution that would allow us to monitor things
      like the time it takes to run a rest execution and amplify issues that we
      came across when performing a test."
    - "**Goals:** To promote awareness of digital books on the usage of the
      latest technologies."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - Manual tests are converted into automated test programs using Selenium
      with Python using a Robot framework. We were then able to execute the
      automated test using Jenkins. We were also able to monitor the tests,
      evaluate the test execution time, and create consolidated reports that
      highlighted improvements and issues found.
    - "It's been a great help to us as functional tests are now fully automated
      and executed. It's now possible to execute multiple runs of the tests and
      to run parallel tests in multiple machines. Overall, Jenkins allowed us:"
    - >-
      *   seamless implementation of pipelines

      *   consolidated reports are easier to prepare

      *   ability to capture test logs takes no time and allows us to quickly analyze and mitigate the failures
