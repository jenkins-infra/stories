  title: Proactive developer solves integration problem with Jenkins.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** I work for the Center for Educational Technology (CET) in
      Israel on a team that supports the development of state-of-the-art
      textbooks and digital content. As a DevOps practitioner, it's essential
      for me to discover smarter and faster ways of implementing all things
      DevOps. It's also important to share what we learn with the community. Let
      me tell you about a solution I discovered for updating a hook
      configuration in Azure Development via an API script for PowerShell."
    - "**Goals:** Global change multiple hooks in Azure Development with
      Jenkins."
    - '**Solution & Results:** We have about 250 hooks in Azure Dev at the
      moment. When developers "checkin" their code, the hook automatically runs
      the job, and Jenkins deploys the code to the servers.'
    - "After the last update to Jenkins, all hooks stopped working. We needed to
      change the basic password to a token because of security measures. For
      this, we had two solutions for change:"
    - |-
      1. To do it manually, which would take about 8 hours, or
      2. Write a script with an Azure API to automate password change
    - "Knowing that a token can live one year, I started to work on an API
      solution. However, I found a bug in Azure API after the 'changed password
      to token hooks' didn't work and opened a Microsoft support ticket. After
      one month of talking to support agents, they told me that \"changing the
      password is not possible via the Rest API.\" Frustrated, I tried one more
      solution: I changed the basic user password to the same token. And it
      started to work!"
    - "I hope this helps someone avoid what I went through. I was happy that
      using Jenkins pipeline:"
    - |-
      * offered a solution for fixing a bug on Azure Dev
      * helped me change all parameters in settings Azure hooks
      * saved me a full day of work!
