  title: Automating CI/CD processes to power an online education platform.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Preply is a global online language learning solution that
      enables over 100,000 students worldwide to interact with instructors while
      learning new languages directly from their computers. To support this
      global online platform, Preply was determined to create an 'Everything as
      a Code' paradigm. That meant ensuring Jenkins code was fully reproducible
      across its infrastructure, configuration, monitoring, jobs, and plugins."
    - "**Goals:** Our goal was to create a fully automated CI/CD process for all
      projects inside our company. No manual intervention, only configuration as
      a code."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We use AWS and manage all our infrastructure
      using Terraform and tools from HashiStack, like Packer and Vault. For
      that, we rely on AWS resources, like EC2 instances, SSL certificates, Load
      Balancers, CloudFront distributions, etc. AMI is built by Packer, which
      integrates perfectly with Terraform and Vault. We've had issues with
      upgrading Jenkins' plugins before, so the main point here was to pin
      versions for them."
    - This is where Docker helps us. We use the pre-built Jenkins image as a
      base image for our setup. Then we employ the Jenkins Configuration as Code
      (JCasC) plugin for storing configuration in a human-readable text format.
      This plugin allows us to describe security configurations, credentials,
      plugin settings, nodes, views and more. Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) allows
      us to configure jobs in a human-readable text format (YAML or JSON). It's
      quite comfortable to manage jobs with SCM.
    - "Now we can set up a CI/CD process using JJB. That's made our development
      easier. Every engineer can make any changes in any pipeline through the
      Pull Request. No manual changes, only code! With this implementation, we
      have:"

      *   a more stable Jenkins environment
      *   the ability to easily change Jenkins and job configuration
      *   a way to restore Jenkins quickly after an accident
