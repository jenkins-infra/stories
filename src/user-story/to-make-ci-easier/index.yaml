  title: Bringing our clients closer to their clients with Jenkins and CI.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** As a marketing agency, with a presence in Spain and Peru,
      we help our clients to interact with their clients, offering them
      innovative marketing and technology solutions. We provide services for all
      phases of the consumer life cycle , helping brands keep customers longer,
      increase the recurrence of interactions with them, and generate greater
      benefits. In achieving this, our main challenge was to develop a common
      Jenkins job that can be used by all of our departments. Each department
      has its own development process, so we need to be flexible to be able to
      cover all of them."
    - "**Goals:** Simplify deployments."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Jenkins is our continuous integration core. Our
      jobs are fully code-managed by using Jenkins pipelines. Our Jobs go from
      deployments based on Docker to Asterisk Dialplan deployments or serverless
      app deployments based on AWS S3 + cloudfront. We also have a Cron service
      based on Jenkins, each department has its own pipelines repository and we
      listen to their webhooks in order to update changes or create new Jobs."
    - Key capabilities used? Our Jobs usually are based on Pipeline, Webhooks,
      Git Plugin, Shell Blocks and HTTP Request Plugins.
    - "As for results, take a look:"
    - >-
      *   Up to 200 apps deployments per day

      *   Serverless apps package time reduced from several hours to less than one

      *   Multiple hours if work saved with etl processes migration to Jenkins
