  title: Building a better software delivery lifecycle for healthcare insurance.
  paragraphs:
    - \*\**Organization:* \*\*A regional division of a US-based health insurance
      provider
    - "***Team Members:*** James Dean, Manager; Dawn Cox, Team Lead; Louis
      Kinnick, DevOps Specialist; Peter Carenza, DevOps Specialist"
    - "***Platform***\\*:\\* Windows"
    - \*\**Programming Language:* \*\*Java, C/C++, Node.js, COBOL, Groovy
    - \*\**Community Support:* \*\*Jenkins.io websites & blogs, Spoke with
      colleagues and peers
    - "**Background:** Peter Carenza is part of a regional team of a well-known
      health insurer that included manager James Dean, team lead Dawn Cox, and
      DevOps specialist, Louis Kinnick. Together, they had to migrate from a
      build system that was so antiquated it forced users to build their own
      batch scripting to facilitate complex builds and unit testing.
      Furthermore, developers in the company had no way of using this old build
      system to incorporate code quality and code/component security."
    - "**Goals:** Speeding up and enhancing the software delivery lifecycle for
      this healthcare insurer."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We replaced our RTC/Jazz build engines with their
      Jenkins counterparts, and proceeded to write Jenkins pipelines as
      templates -- automation code for build, test, and deploy -- that allowed
      users to customize details through the use of build properties."
    - We used Jenkins' wide array of plugins to incorporate new development
      tools for code security, code quality, inline troubleshooting, feedback
      loops, and governance. We also automated integration with our deployment
      solution, and suddenly we found a whole realm of possibilities using
      environment gates, continuous delivery and deployment.
    - And that wasn't all! A segment of our team was broken off to handle
      corporate patch delivery. Not only were we able to deliver that
      seamlessly, but Jenkins allowed us to mass-test the servers (or single out
      a server or patch group) with the click of a button. Jenkins pipelines are
      the best thing we have come across in our transformation to Agile. It's
      used to automate our entire end-to-end development process and utilize
      Scripted Pipelines to abstract every single team's unique build.
    - "For capabilities: We used Scripted DSL pipelines to code five different
      build types and run all of our builds through those parameterized
      pipelines. We use Build Failure Analysis to maintain a large
      troubleshooting and diagnosis database for common build and delivery
      issues. And we use Extended Email to deliver detailed, visually pleasing
      notifications that provide all the feedback the developer needs to analyze
      the progress of their build. Though we have migrated from Jazz Builds to
      Jenkins, we still use Jazz Source Control, and the Team Concert plugin
      offers an amazing bridge to the rest of our pipeline."
    - Our results?
    - >-
      *   shortened release cycles from months to days.

      *   reduced our service call frequency by half with the use of Build Failure Analysis

      *   widespread patch testing has been automated, reducing the need to have a rep from every development team on a patch validation

      *   by incorporating an open-source Jenkins solution over Jazz build engine, we saved thousands of dollars on licenses

      *   nearly elimination of custom build scripts in favor of standardized wide scope solutions
