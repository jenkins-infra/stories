  title: Building a DevOps platform with near infinite scaling capacity.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** We started using Jenkins standalone, and it worked
      perfectly fine for six months. But with more and more teams using the tool
      and an increasing load, we naturally hit the performance overhead."
    - Since we didn't have Kubernetes then, the only options we had were to
      either opt for a master-agent configuration through servers or scale the
      server vertically by adding more CPU and memory. We chose the latter as it
      was quicker and more comfortable for us. However, we realized this wasn't
      going to last long, and started looking for alternative options.
      Eventually, the CTO of the company decided to go ahead with a cloud
      strategy. That was good for us.
    - "**Goals:** Our ultimate goal was to seamlessly enable DevOps within the
      organization. Therefore, we decided to move our Jenkins to the cloud and
      shift it to a Kubernetes cluster we had built and had migrated all tools
      to."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We had two options: either containerise the
      master and use it standalone or build a scalable Jenkins by using
      Kubernetes. We came up with the following architecture: One replica of
      Jenkins master runs as a control plane. All users log in to the master to
      build and manage their jobs. Using the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin, we then
      employ Kubernetes to spin up additional Jenkins agent containers when
      someone triggers a build. It runs the job in the container and, when
      successful, removes the container."
    - Jenkins allowed us to run builds in a scalable fashion and more or less
      independent way. This allowed multiple builds to run in parallel with a
      near infinite scaling capacity. It also helped us optimise cost due to the
      elasticity of the Kubernetes Infrastructure and Google Cloud platform in
      general. The results?
    - |-
      *   builds are 10X faster
      *   cost reduction as Jenkins uses the same Kubernetes cluster
      *   faster time to delivery because of no performance bottlenecks
