  title: Getting reliable, in-time alerts in PagerDuty.
  paragraphs:
    - '**Background:** When delivering real-time ads in the marketplace,
      ensuring your developers were on call to respond to fixes as needed is a
      critical component in any software situation. We found that our developer
      alerts were being generated using a "mediator." This meant that builds
      that failed or yielded metrics that should have been triggering an alert
      were doing so by sending an email to the Network Operations Center. The
      NOC, in turn, was then contacting the responsible team or developer. This
      pass-along process caused a delay in attending to the issues at hand,
      correcting the failures, and resuming the build.'
    - In many cases, the cycle of an alert having to run through a NOC
      eliminates any sense of urgency. It could take up to 30 minutes before a
      party responsible might be alerted an appropriate action took place. This
      delay can significantly affect builds and pipelines. It took me by
      surprise that there was no PagerDuty plugin for Jenkins yet, so I decided
      to develop and open-source it.
    - "**Goals: Build a new Jenkins plugin to alert developers of issues and
      accelerate response and resolution times.**"
    - "**Solution & Results:** We took inspiration from PagerDuty, an incident
      management platform that provides reliable notifications, automatic
      escalations, on-call scheduling, and other functionality to help teams
      detect and fix infrastructure problems quickly. The mobile app allows you
      to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents."
    - After figuring out the need for a [Jenkins PagerDuty
      plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pagerduty/), it was an easy choice to
      turn to Jenkins documentation and codebase. This is actually a really
      awesome way to get to know Jenkins in-depth, much more than just using it
      to execute pipelines or run ad hoc jobs. After going over possible plugin
      options, PagerDuty was created as a post-build notifier plugin.
    - One of the critical capabilities to getting this done is the overall
      extendability of all the components. Plus, the Jenkins community and
      documentation played a considerable role in the quick development and
      adoption of the plugin.
    - We now have an option to trigger and resolve PagerDuty incidents directly
      from builds and pipelines. In addition, we shortened the "Alert to
      Resolution" cycle from one half-hour to just a few minutes. Best of all,
      we now have a better and holistic understanding of Jenkins internals.
    - "With the open source PagerDuty plugin, we achieved our goals and more,
      including:"
    - >-
      *   The ability to trigger incidents on various job statuses: Success,
      Failure, Aborted, Unstable, & Not Built

      *   The ability to trigger incidents based on number of consecutive build results

      *   The ability to automatically resolve incidents when job is back to normal

      *   Being pipeline compatible
