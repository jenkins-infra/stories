  title: Simplifying card payments requires simplifying every task that makes a
    financial transaction successful.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** As a part of a software development and design agency,
      with clients in nearly every industry, you constantly assess best
      practices to help businesses transform to meet new market expectations.
      The same is true when peering inward and looking at your own organization
      and processes. Lara Evdokimova, a Senior QA and Test Engineer based in
      Russia, had the opportunity to do just that as she approaches build
      testing for global clients and supports agency offices worldwide."
    - "**Goals:** Simplify a fintech customer's processing of financial
      transactions through credit card payments."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - "\"Our approach to task management is considered through a web
      interface,\" said Lara, \"where we can configure anything, support it with
      a large number of tasks, and their diversity, that is, simplify jobs and
      speed up the tickets' creation.\""
    - 'Lara and her global team relied on Jenkins. "Our Jenkins has jobs:
      task-generator seed-job and a pipeline-type task named testpipeline-build.
      In the test pipeline, I will collect a Docker image, which will then be
      uploaded to the local Docker registry. The image file will be taken from
      another project."'
    - To run this task automatically, Lara then adds a webhook in a project with
      a docker-image, where this task will run after sending changes to the
      repository. As a result, the ready pipeline will be in the BlueOcean
      interface in Jenkins.
    - "**Capabilities used:**"
    - |-
      *   Jenkins job builder
      *   DSL plugin
      *   Jenkins pipeline
      *   Gitlab & Gitlab CI
    - "**Results:**"
    - >-
      *   build times are 6X faster

      *   improved product quality is 3X simpler and quicker

      *   the processes of continuous integration are built as comfortably as possible
