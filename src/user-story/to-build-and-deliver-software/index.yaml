  title: Providing visibility, flexibility, and stability for a global defense
    technology organization.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** This international organization supports the development
      of advanced defense and intelligence electronics, including sensors,
      radars, electronic warfare and communication systems. In order to support
      multiple development environments, numerous languages, and to be adaptable
      for varying levels of technical expertise across the organization, this
      DevOps team chose to upgrade their control system using Jenkins."
    - "**Goals:** Enabling all stakeholders with improved project visibility and
      faster feedback."
    - "**Solution & Results:** The use of Jenkins allowed us to uncouple a lot
      of the stuff embedded into our development infrastructure. In doing so, we
      were able to treat each as a unique subject in its entirety, i.e. 'build
      scripts'. The key to our success was the ability to integrate it with
      ClearCase, an older version control system."
    - We migrated to Gitlab, which was a piece of cake since no changes were
      made to the process itself. The ongoing development of Jenkins plugins
      allowed us to integrate it easily into all of our internal systems. It
      also gave us support for bugs by providing visibility into issues once the
      integration was in progress.
    - "Jenkins helped us achieve our goal relatively fast and at no cost! We
      achieved our primary goal to build unified visibility across the entire
      organization, plus we experienced other benefits, including:"
    - |-
      *   user engagement
      *   manager engagement
      *   faster delivery
      *   project confidence
