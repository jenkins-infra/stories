  title: The tech team at Avoris Travel sought to minimize their delivery cycle
    times. Tapping into Jenkins' vast number of plugins available, the team was
    able to speed up their CI/CD and reduce build times over 50%.

  title: Minimizing delivery cycle times by speeding up CI/CD.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Avoris Travel is a unique travel tour operator serving
      Spain and Portugal with a global presence in 15 Latin American countries
      and beyond. At its core, the company is driven by digital transformation,
      so it's no wonder that when the performance of their build times was on
      the decline, the team knew it needed improvements."
    - "With Kubernetes slaves, we saw that within each Jenkins build,
      dependencies are downloaded to an .m2 directory, which is subsequently
      deleted after the build. Then, when generating the final image to be
      delivered in the different environments, a similar problem was uncovered:
      image layers, which are common to each build, are also being downloaded
      and subsequently deleted."
    - "**Goals:** Minimize delivery cycle times."
    - "**Solution & Results:** To solve the continuous and repetitive download
      of maven dependencies, we decided to use the mounted volumes offered by
      the Kubernetes plugin, mapping the agent's directory
      (/var/jenkins\\_home/.m2) to a shared directory on the Kubernetes nodes
      (/mnt/home-jenkins-m2). This allows all builds to share the same .m2."
    - To ensure security and concurrency, we installed the Takari plugin
      (Concurrent Safe Local Repository). To solve the repetitive download of
      images and base layers, we opted to use host path volumes, as we did with
      maven dependencies, mapping the agent's directory
      (/var/run/containers/storage) to the /mnt/var-run-containers-storage node
      directory. We were able to do all this thanks to the use of the overlay
      storage driver. The creation of images is done with Buildah, while the
      upload to the clusters is made possible with Skopeo.
    - "All of our builds are performed on Kubernetes agent nodes. Jenkins is our
      own Docker image based on the official Jenkins compressed file (LTS). We
      add other packages such as the Takari plugin, jcasc config, and the
      Openshift CLI to perform some cluster operations. The structure of our
      jobs is based on Bitbucket multi-branch pipelines, which all share a
      Jenkins shared library. These are hosted in a git repo, which -- in turn
      -- contains all the stages of the pipelines. Now, any modification applies
      to all developments. We use parameterized Jenkinsfiles based on technology
      and other parameters to configure the builds. For example (Jenkinsfile):"
    - Our project was successful due to the vast number of Jenkins plugins
      available, the extensibility of Jenkinsfiles with the use of Groovy, and
      many integration possibilities. Additionally, we relied on a large and
      helpful Jenkins community and all the Jenkins resources available.
    - "Our goal to minimize delivery cycle times exceeded our expectations:"
    - >-
      *   for small applications, we reduced the average build times from 45
      seconds to just 8 seconds

      *   for larger legacy apps, build times of more than 10-15 minutes were shaved by 7-8 minutes

      *   depending on the size of the base image, we've reduced the final image generation time by 10-30 seconds
