  title: Transition off an old, slow and manual build system to something built
    for the future.
  paragraphs:
    - \*\**Organization:* \*\*Development project for a healthcare company
    - \*\**Programming Language:* \*\*Java
    - "***Platform***\\*:\\* Docker or Kubernetes, Linux"
    - \*\**Community Support:* \*\*Jenkins.io websites & blogs
    - "**Background:** A healthcare company reached out to this IT group because
      they needed to have a faster way to build, test, and deploy applications,
      while automating as much of the testing and quality checks as possible.
      Their former build process was very slow and manual, and did only that:
      build. Any additional testing or quality checks were additional manual
      steps. This IT team set out to change all that."
    - "**Goals:** Introducing a new platform for running applications. We were
      also trying to modernize the tooling related to our build (switching from
      Ant to Maven and Subversion to Git)."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We were transitioning off an old build system. We
      used Jenkins to set up a new continuous integration process for our new
      applications which significantly streamlined the build process. By
      reviewing the old process as we were moving to Jenkins, we were able to
      identify areas where we could develop a more automated process. Our old
      system required builds to manually be triggered. Jenkins, of course, came
      ready to build and integrate changes on check-in, providing faster
      feedback and better indications of the application's build health."
    - We were then able to take advantage of Jenkins' extensive plugin ecosystem
      to add several additional steps to the automated build process. We
      improved our automated testing and reporting to give more confidence in
      our releases. We added security and quality scanning to keep our code more
      robust, secure, and maintainable. The entire process saved hours of manual
      effort, and produced better applications!
    - "Key capabilities included: JUnit reporting, SonarQube scanning, Checkmarx
      scanning, Docker image building, and Groovy scripting."
    - And our results?
    - |-
      *   faster resolution on build failures
      *   improved quality
      *   improved application security
