  title: Building 100+ microservices with a common UI, before independently
    testing and deploying each.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** This project, supported by telecommunications giant
      AT\\&T, required us to have more than 100 microservices deployed
      independently. The challenge was to set up a CI/CD pipeline and integrate
      all the plugins in order to reduce the time spent on the project for our
      team of developers. We wanted to manage the build cycle of all individual
      microservices by giving them a common UI. But we also needed to see the
      status of each microservice separately."
    - "**Goals:** The goal of this project was to provide world-class features
      for the Unified Communication domain. This includes features like Voice,
      Video, and a VoIP calling feature with reach Webex capability. We also
      needed to manage multiple users using admin logins."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Jenkins provided the best solution as per our
      actual need. Jenkins comes with an easy setup and very user-friendly
      documentation, which helped us hit the ground running. We started with POC
      and quickly took it to production for all our deployments. We were able to
      manage all our microservices using Jenkins UI."
    - Jenkins not only made setting up our instance of CI/CD really easy, but it
      also helped us to visualize the error and failures using its logs. Jenkins
      lets us track the deployment process and keep the DevOps team in the loop
      as to when additional support will be needed.
    - We relied on plugins such as Relic which helped us to create an autonomous
      email tool for build failure. It was very helpful, as it lets us track the
      deployment process and keep the DevOps team in the loop as to when
      additional support will be needed.

    - "The results are typical of so many Jenkins installations but impressive
      nonetheless. They include:"
    - |-
      *   Improved build times
      *   Automated test cases
      *   Application build monitoring
      *   Cost-cutting
      *   High performance and delivery
