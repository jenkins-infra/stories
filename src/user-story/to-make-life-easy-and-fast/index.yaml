  title: Better visibility and bigger, badder pipelines.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** TOPIC develops digital hardware, FPGA and software for
      customers. From board design, low-level driver development to application
      development for desktop, web and mobile. We support as a consultant, but
      also provide in-house projects and healthcare solutions. Unfortunately,
      pipeline limitations slowed us down."
    - "**Goals:** Create a large pipeline to automate the qualification process."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Using JENKINS pipelines enabled us to execute our
      complete qualification process during the night. Manual steps are
      removed/solved to make this happen. This automated the process, with some
      parts executed in parallel and in different nodes. Both the release cycle
      and the visualization increased tremendously. All results are visible in
      Jenkins, and everybody has access to those results. We use pipelines with
      Jenkins files in a Git repo. Also, Blue Ocean is rocking!"
    - Result?
    - |-
      *   Release cycle from days to one night
      *   Quality improved by removing manual actions
      *   Insanely better visibility
