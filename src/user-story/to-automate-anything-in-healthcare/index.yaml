  title: Speeding warning notifications and improving release time productivity by
    50X.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** The work we're doing is for a global company that
      provides scientific instrumentation, software and services to healthcare,
      life science, and other laboratories in academia, government, and biotech
      and pharmaceutical industries. We had many technical challenges in our
      project, including building artifact distribution, identifying all
      warnings in code, automating build release workflow, headless testing, and
      data collection software which needs to be automated in its workflow.
      Because we have nearly 20 jobs in our enterprise Jenkins, we settled with
      Jenkins for all of our automation needs."
    - "**Goals:** To develop software that can help simplify DNA sequencing
      analysis on the fly."
    - "**Solution & Results:** With the help of Jenkins, we have nearly 20
      successful builds. Each resolves the requirements for that particular job.
      For example, one Jenkins job helps us identify all the critical warnings
      present in code whenever we push new code using the SpotBugs plugin -- is
      a program that uses static analysis to look for bugs in Java code. This is
      very crucial for developers. Another Jenkins job was to automate build
      image distribution. This used to be very messy due to a lack of version
      tracking, especially with so many duplicate copies of builds. Jenkins
      helped us streamline this process with single deployment, track all
      versions, and allow wide distribution of builds among the team for
      testing, verifications, etc."
    - The key capabilities we relied on included creating local Jenkins jobs and
      using the Android plugin for SDK management and GitHub plugin to
      streamline copy cloning. We also love knowing that the SpotBugs plugin
      integration can read an XML file and show results on the dashboard when
      the build is over. That part is awesome.
    - "Our top 5 results are as follows:"
    - |-
      *   warnings identification is faster than ever
      *   build releases to teams is streamlined
      *   improved tracking of build versions
      *   50x more productivity during release times
      *   automation of so many tasks made the lives of our developers easier
