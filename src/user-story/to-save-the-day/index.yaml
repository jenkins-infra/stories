  title: Introduce a secret engine under the hood to allow developers to create
    without limitations.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** Being a consultant to a corporate client, one in the
      financial services industry, means you must navigate processes that are
      fairly rigid. To hit our milestones and achieve successful outcomes, we
      needed to cobble together multiple technologies and API's into
      reproducible workflows."
    - "**Goals:** To create an independent orchestration tool that would allow
      developers to build independently without relying on unnecessary resources
      and check-ins, and to shave time off of the development cycle."
    - "**Solution & Results:** We used Jenkins to expose one API fronting a
      Jenkins workflow. We were able to develop workflows to allow developers
      and infrastructure resources to create the resources they needed without
      hitting the limitations of the downstream tools used. It also allowed us
      to meet the needs of the 3rd party RBAC requirements."
    - When working in corporate environments you face slow-moving teams or very
      rigid processes that take long times to change. Jenkins enabled us to
      abstract these pain points away from our customers. We were also able to
      create custom portals to front API access to Jenkins so the users never
      knew they were working via Jenkins. It was the secret engine underneath
      the hood.
    - Jenkins workflows and cross-platform compatibility were key for us. Being
      able to host individual steps in our workflow across Windows and Linux
      hosts allows us to leverage the OS tools we needed to build and deploy our
      resources.
    - "Results were as follows:"
    - >-
      *   using Jenkins, we reduced the number of users needed to participate in
      complex workflows

      *   resources could be built immediately, or once approval had occurred

      *   the project timeline was pulled in by months due to the flexible processes that were created

      Java shop using Groovy it helped out a ton.
