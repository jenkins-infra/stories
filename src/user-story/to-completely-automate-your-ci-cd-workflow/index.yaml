  title: Windows? Linux? Jenkins automation platform serves both.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** For my particular client, Autoweb, the main challenge was
      to automate deployment on a Window-based environment. While we had done so
      on Linux environments, this was new for us."
    - "**Goals:** Automate deployment process integrating CI/CD."
    - "**Solution & Results:** As we had previously used Jenkins Pipelines and
      Ansible on Linux environments, we concluded it was the best approach to
      maintain the standard pipeline jobs we already had. So we implemented
      Ansible on Windows based environments using WinRM to give Ansible control
      over Windows Servers. All of this was orchestrated by a Linux-based
      Jenkins Main Server, and a bunch of Windows/Jenkins agents to do the
      builds and QA tests."
    - "With all of this in place, we were able to write Jenkins pipelines as we
      usually do, but for Windows Deployments. Jenkins Pipelines served us very
      well for defining different stages:"
    - |-
      1.  Source Code Pull
      2.  Build
      3.  Package
      4.  Deploy
      5.  Pool Restart
      6.  Test
      7.  Notification
    - All of this occurs in a very organized and standardized way, which is easy
      to replicate within similar projects and also very easy to troubleshoot.
    - "The Jenkins capabilities we relied on for this project included: Jenkins
      Pipelines, Jenkins Ansible Plugin, Git plugin, and MSBuild Plugin. One key
      feature we deployed was Jenkins Blue Ocean, since a main requirement was
      the need for approvals between steps. Blue Ocean was key to give a pretty
      decent user interface for project managers and product owners to review
      and approve any changes or deployments. Jenkins DSL Jobs Rules is also
      great since it makes it possible to parametrize every job and create jobs
      on-the-fly in an automated fashion."
    - I love how flexible and powerful Jenkins is. It has limitless
      capabilities, and is the perfect choice for an automation platform.
    - "With Jenkins:"
    - >-
      *   deployments are now consistent and repeatable

      *   deployment time decreased from weeks to 8 minutes

      *   replication across similar projects is easy

      *   standardized deployments can be done under the same scheme within Linux and Windows environments

      *   rollback strategy is now simple to execute
