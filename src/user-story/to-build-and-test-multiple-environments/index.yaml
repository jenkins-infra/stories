  title: Empowering people to do their very best work means making sure cloud
    pipelines are running smoothly.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** I work for an American multinational software company
      that provides server, application and desktop virtualization, networking,
      software as a service (SaaS), and cloud computing technologies. Our
      services and products are used by over 400,000 clients worldwide,
      including 99% of the Fortune 100, and 98% of the Fortune 500."
    - To keep things running smoothly for new deployments, I needed to develop
      an easy-to-maintain and reliable cloud development pipeline to allow for
      the constant building of production environment configurations.
    - "**Goals:** Automate cloud deployments."
    - "**Solution & Results:**"
    - Jenkins pipelines allowed us to automate our cloud development process and
      combine them all within one source of truth. We were able to build
      multiple environments at the same time which, eventually, allowed us to
      build, deploy and test without much manual intervention.
    - "The results are typical of many other successful Jenkins installations:"
    - |-
      *   build times are 3x faster
      *   we can test our code as we build it
      *   we have the ability to have the status for each step in the pipeline
