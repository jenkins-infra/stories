  title: Making more agile deliverables through Jenkins integration.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background:** PT Len Industri is engaged in the Indonesian electronics
      industry. The technology that Len has developed has a strategic role in
      improving the welfare of society which is channeled through renewable
      energy products. LEN also continues to actively support Indonesia by
      providing products in the fields of defense, transportation, and ICT."
    - "**Goals:** The primary goal of this program is to build a robust
      integration system -- air, surface, subsurface, land -- to support
      situational awareness and tactical actions. We were looking to make more
      agile deliverables that are easier to manage and maintain. Secondary goals
      were to work better as a team, improve continuous delivery schedules,
      easily merge with new features, and accommodate changing schedules and
      requirements."
    - "**Solution & Results:** Working as a team, we need a code integrator to
      deploy and test. We also have continuous delivery schedules and factory
      acceptance tests with users for each release period. We maintain every
      released product installed and rebuild new features to be set up for the
      next delivery. Sometimes it's challenging when versioning must be released
      because user's schedules and requirements are constantly changing. But
      with Jenkins and other DevOps tools -- like automatic code integration and
      continuous delivery -- we have found a better balance and happier
      developers."
    - "Results that come to mind include:"
    - |-
      *   controlled pipeline release cycles and faster development
      *   improved product and code quality with SonarQube
      *   well-integrated with other DevOps tools and automation
      *   extensible
      *   open source
