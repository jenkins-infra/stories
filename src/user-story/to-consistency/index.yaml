  title: Developing a consistent, near-effortless build process for multiple teams.
  paragraphs:
    - "**Background: This company provides expertise and technology in support
      of national security missions and government transformation for defense,
      intelligence, and civilian customers. The technology team maintains a
      baseline on multiple networks and has numerous repositories to release.
      Because of this, they transitioned to a new Continuous Integration and
      Delivery pipeline that provides a single source of record while allowing
      them cross-network sync of day-to-day build processes.**"
    - "**Goals:** Shorten integration and minimize the effort required at each
      release and on each network."
    - "**Solution & Results:** To build this new CI/CD platform, we chose to use
      Jenkins pipelines, which enabled us to create a suite of pipeline
      libraries and jobs and allowed us to fully control the build & deployment
      of our releases across networks. Best of all, we were able to coordinate
      all the build jobs in a configurable, reusable fashion."
    - The key Jenkins capabilities we employed were pipelines, as mentioned, as
      well as pipeline libraries and Job DSL.
    - While our pipelines are pretty straight forward, Jenkins allows us to
      manage them consistently across the organization. Also, Jenkins has the
      flexibility to handle unique build processes in a documented and
      controlled fashion.
    - "We now have a single source of record for our build process, but using
      Jenkins also allows us to sync that process to other networks as
      applicable. Our new CI/CD pipeline enables us to:"
    - >-
      *   simplify the build process for the development team

      *   require less effort to set up our build environments on different networks

      *   maintain consistent build processes across multiple teams
