    and development cycles shortened from 20 days to a week.

  title: Testing improvements allow for aggressive development with fewer errors.
  paragraphs:
    - \*\**Organization:* \*\*Virtusa, IT consultant for a UK-based
      telecommunications company
    - \*\**Team:* \*\*Abhijit MIsal, Software Engineer, and Nirmiti Pawar,
      Software Engineer, both of Virtusa
    - \*\**Community Support:* \*\*Spoke with colleagues and peers, Networking
      at Jenkins event, and relied on Jenkins.io websites & blogs
    - "**Background:** Virtusa is a global provider of innovative products and
      services that create operational efficiency for their clients using
      digital labor, future-proof operational and IT platforms, and
      rationalization and modernization of IT applications infrastructure. In
      his role as lead consultant, Ajit Gunge worked with software engineers
      Abhijit MIsal and Nirmiti Pawar to build a workflow management system for
      a UK-based telecommunications powerhouse."
    - With a monthly release cycle for the application the operations team
      always had to wait for new features as well as critical bug fixes. This
      was delaying the overall software delivery which in turn delayed the
      number of customer orders getting delivered on the ground. Ultimately,
      this had a negative impact on end-user experiences.
    - "**Goals:** To build a more efficient workflow for the operations team. We
      knew we had to increase flexibility and reduce the manual effort. We knew
      we would be able to accelerate our software delivery by automating our
      Continuous Integration process."
    - "**Solution & Results:** The problems end-users were faced with included
      delayed software features and, at times, buggy software. These problems
      were solved by an accelerated delivery process using Jenkins. The
      developers were informed at an early stage of software coding where the
      bugs lie, and they were able to resolve them quickly. Jenkins enabled us
      to quickly integrate the software , and now, with daily builds and a CI
      process in place, we see more frequent deliveries and fewer defects,
      finally enriching the user experience. The operations team was able to
      work more efficiently on the software and ultimately, was able to deliver
      more orders to our client's end customers.Plugins that we found useful to
      meet our goal of building a workflow management system with Jenkins
      include: Continuous integration and code pipelines, Build Name setter,
      Build PipelIne, Cobertura, Delivery Pipeline, Email Extension, Git,
      Jacoco, Parameterized Trigger, Rebuilder Plugin, Workspace Cleanup, HTML
      publisher, and Amazon EC2.Our results?\\*   build times are 10x faster"
